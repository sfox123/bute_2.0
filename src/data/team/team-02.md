description: "
  We believe in the efficient use of finite natural resources and actively promote the transition to a circular economy. This involves conserving water, reducing waste through design, and reusing and recovering materials whenever possible. We prioritize the use of recycled and secondary materials from other industries as raw materials for our products and fuels for our production processes. As a result, we consume more waste than we produce.

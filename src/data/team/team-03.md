description: "
We maximize opportunities for recycling and reusing our waste, and we constantly seek innovative and proactive solutions in this field. Sending waste to landfill is an absolute last resort. Our current recycling figures indicate that 98% of all waste generated is recycled. For concrete mixing and aggregate production, we utilize high-quality recycled materials from our own sites. Additionally, our asphalt production follows a Waste and Resources Action Plan (WRAP) to minimize environmental impact. Through collaboration with our contacts and contracts, we ensure that materials no longer in use are repurposed elsewhere. If reuse is not possible or viable, we segregate and recycle these materials appropriately.

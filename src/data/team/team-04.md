description: "
We recognize that our industry has a significant impact on natural resources, and with the growing concern for climate change and resource depletion, there is a pressing need to reduce our environmental footprint. So, we take a comprehensive approach to managing energy and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of our operations. This includes considering the materials we use, our operations, transportation of products, their performance during use, and recycling or disposal at the end of their life. Our investments in energy and carbon-efficient technologies, waste-derived fuels, renewable energy sources, and responsible supply chain management help reduce the carbon footprint of our products.

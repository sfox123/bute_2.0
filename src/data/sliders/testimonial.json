      "text": "A team of engineers re-constructed our pavements in Hawthorn Close, Harpenden recently. Unfortunately both I and my husband, who had open heart surgery a few weeks ago, had medical appointments every morning of the work being done on our side of the road. The team were so helpful and so accommodating, allowing us to have our car on our property and letting us off and on during the week. We realise this made their timing more difficult but at no time was there anything but courtesy shown to us.Thank you to the team and your company for such excellent training."
